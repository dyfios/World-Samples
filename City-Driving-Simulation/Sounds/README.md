# Audio Assets Directory

This directory is for future audio enhancements to the City Driving Simulation.

## Planned Audio Files

### Vehicle Sounds
- `engine-idle.wav` - Engine idle sound loop
- `engine-rev.wav` - Engine acceleration sound
- `engine-decel.wav` - Engine deceleration sound
- `brake.wav` - Braking sound effect
- `horn.wav` - Vehicle horn sound
- `tire-screech.wav` - Tire screeching on pavement

### Environmental Audio
- `traffic-ambient.wav` - General city traffic ambience
- `city-ambience.wav` - Urban background sounds
- `wind.wav` - Wind sound for outdoor areas

### UI Sounds
- `ui-click.wav` - Interface interaction sound
- `warning-beep.wav` - System warning sound
- `respawn-sound.wav` - Vehicle respawn notification

## Audio Requirements

### Format
- WAV or MP3 format
- 44.1kHz sample rate minimum
- 16-bit depth minimum

### Quality Guidelines
- Keep file sizes reasonable for web delivery
- Use compression for ambient loops
- Ensure sounds are normalized and balanced

## Implementation Status

Audio integration is not currently implemented in the scripts but can be added as an enhancement. The vehicle controller and traffic system are designed to support audio integration through the WebVerse audio APIs.

## Future Integration

Audio can be integrated using the WebVerse `AudioEntity` and `Sound` APIs:

```javascript
// Example audio integration
const engineSound = new AudioEntity(vehicleEntity, "Sounds/engine-idle.wav", true, 1.0);
engineSound.Play();
```

See the main README.md for more details on planned enhancements.
